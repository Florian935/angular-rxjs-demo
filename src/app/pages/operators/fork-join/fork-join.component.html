<h2>forkJoin Operator</h2>

<p>
    See console to see result. Subscribe to a source and combine the emitted
    source value with 2 anothers observables source and multiply the source
    value by 2 and 3
</p>
<p>
    forkJoin will <strong>WAIT for all passed observables to emit</strong> and
    complete and <strong>THEN</strong> it will emit an array or an object
    <strong>ONLY with last values</strong> from corresponding observables.
